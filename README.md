# EventHive - Event Registration & Check-in Platform

## 🚀 Overview
**EventHive** is a modern, responsive web application designed to streamline the event management lifecycle. It allows users to discover events and register instantly, while providing organizers with a powerful dashboard to track analytics and manage attendee check-ins.

This is **Phase 1 (Frontend)** of the project. It operates entirely in the browser using **Mock Service Worker (MSW)** to simulate a robust backend API, offering a realistic development experience without requiring a running server.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌍 For Users
- **Event Discovery**: Browse upcoming events with powerful search, filtering (Upcoming, Full, Completed), and sorting options.
- **Instant Registration**: Simple registration flow that generates a unique **QR Code** ticket upon success.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for seamless use on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Sharing**: Easily copy and share event links with friends.

### 📊 For Organizers (Dashboard)
- **Real-time Analytics**: specific metrics for Total Events, Total Registrations, and Check-in Rates.
- **Check-in System**: Simulate scanning QR codes to mark attendees as "Checked In".
- **Data Management**: View detailed lists of registrants with pagination and search.
- **Export Data**: Download registration data as CSV for external processing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Core**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (Icons)
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Network**: Axios
- **Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker) for client-side API simulation

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Initialize MSW**
   This downloads the necessary service worker file to the `public/` directory.
   ```bash
   npm run postinstall
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The application will launch at `http://localhost:5173`.

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🧪 How the Mock Backend Works

This project uses **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** to intercept network requests generated by the application.
- **No Backend Required**: All "database" operations happen in the browser's memory.
- **Realistic Latency**: An artificial delay (600ms) is added to all requests to simulate real-world network conditions.
- **Note**: Since data is stored in memory, refreshing the page will reset the application state to the default seed data.

## 🚀 Deployment

The project is pre-configured for **Vercel**:
- `vite.config.ts`: Configured with relative base paths for preview environments.
- `vercel.json`: Handles SPA routing rewrites (directing all traffic to `index.html`).

To deploy, simply connect your repository to Vercel and it will automatically detect the Vite build settings.
